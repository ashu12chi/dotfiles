# dotfiles
Collection of files (mainly dotfiles) needed by me every time I set up a new GNU/ Linux system (Debian based), also serves as backup.

[instructions.md](https://github.com/nisiddharth/dotfiles/blob/master/instructions.md) has more instructions.

[apt_installed.txt](https://github.com/nisiddharth/dotfiles/blob/master/apt_installed.txt) has list of apt installed packages.
